# IoT Dashboard for CO Reduction & System Monitoring

##  Overview

This project is a real-time IoT monitoring dashboard built to measure and enhance carbon monoxide (CO) reduction in vehicle exhaust systems using a CuO-coated mesh catalyst. It features live data visualization, interactive analytics, and a clean, responsive interface for monitoring key system parameters.
